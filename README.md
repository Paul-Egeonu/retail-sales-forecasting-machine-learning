This project builds a **machine learning pipeline to forecast daily sales** for over 1,000 Rossmann stores across Europe.  
The goal is to **predict sales six weeks into the future**, helping management plan for **inventory, staffing, and promotions**.

## 📊 Dataset  

- **train.csv** → Historical daily sales for Rossmann stores (2013–2015).  
- **test.csv** → Data for the forecast horizon.  
- **store.csv** → Metadata about stores (e.g., store type, assortment, competition info).  
- **sample_submission.csv** → Required format for predictions.  

Key columns include:  
- `Store`: Unique ID for each store  
- `Sales`: Target variable → daily sales  
- `Customers`: Number of customers  
- `Open`: Store open flag (0 = closed)  
- `Promo`: Whether the store had a promotion that day  
- `SchoolHoliday`: Whether the day was a holiday  

---

## 🔎 Workflow  

1. **Data Exploration & Cleaning**  
   - Checked missing values and store-wise distributions  
   - Explored correlations between promotions, holidays, and sales  

2. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Date decomposition (year, month, week, day, etc.)  
   - Promo & holiday encoding  
   - Competition distance and promo duration features  
   - Log transformation of skewed variables  

3. **Model Training**  
   - Baseline models: Linear Regression, Random Forest  
   - Advanced models: **XGBoost** and **LightGBM**  
   - Hyperparameter tuning via cross-validation  

4. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Metric: **Root Mean Squared Percentage Error (RMSPE)**  
   - XGBoost and LightGBM gave best performance  
   - Feature importance showed `Promo`, `CompetitionDistance`, and `Month` as key drivers  

5. **Forecasting & Visualization**  
   - Predicted store-level daily sales  
   - Compared predicted vs. actual on validation data  

6. **Deployment**  
   - `streamlit_app.py` provides a web interface to forecast sales for any store  
   - Users can input parameters and view predicted sales

## 📈 Key Insights  

- Promotions significantly drive sales uplift  
- Sales vary seasonally, peaking during December  
- Stores with closer competitors have lower sales  
- Some stores are highly promotion-dependent

## 📌 Future Improvements  

- Incorporate **external data** (weather, holidays, macroeconomic trends)  
- Try **deep learning models** (LSTM, Temporal Fusion Transformer)  
- Deploy a full **cloud API** for sales forecasting
